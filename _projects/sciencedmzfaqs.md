## General

What is the gcrNet?
> It is a Science DMZ, a network or a portion of network, designed to facilitate the transfer of  big science data.

How can I access the gcrNet?
> Access to the gcrNet is granted by the gcrNet technical team. The first round of network drops were installed based on a list compiled during the proposal development. Future access will require an application to be submitted to our technical team. If selected to receive a gcrNet network attachment a network port will be installed in your office or lab and you will need a 10GbE Network Interface Card (NIC).

I still have questions. How do I contact you?
> You may contact us using Phone 336-256-8324 and email 6tech@uncg.edu

## Technical

What are the minimum system requirements?
> Unless you have a high-performance workstation chances are your hardware is not immediately compatible with the gcrNet. Users may need to upgrade their systems to include a disk system capable of transfer speeds over the standard 1 Gigabit per second. The 10GbE network enables speeds of up to 1.25 Gigabytes per second. Standard SATA hard drives see speeds of around 150 Megabytes per second, or about 1/10th of the available gcrNet bandwidth.
> The following is a list of must-haves for your system:
> * A workstation with an available PCIe 2.0 x8 slot
> * 10GbE Network Card
> * Storage system capable of high bandwidth transfers
>   * Single SSD drive
>   * Array of SATA/SSD disks

What software is necessary to leverage the gcrNet?
> Traditional file transfer protocols do not support the increased bandwidth available to users on the gcrNet.
> There are two programs commonly used to move large datasets over high-bandwidth networks:
> * [Globus](https://docs.globus.org/)
> * [bbcp](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/)         
> Both your local workstation and the remote data source will need matching software.

How can I verify the gcrNet speeds?
> Several network performance diagnostics tools will be available to test connectivity speeds.
> * [perfSONAR-PS](http://psps.perfsonar.net/toolkit/) The pS-Performance Toolkit is a downloadable, pre-configured collection of network performance tools, including NDT, BWCTL, OWAMP and perfSONAR tools and services.
> * [Bandwidth Test Controller (BWCTL)](http://software.internet2.edu/bwctl/) BWCTL is a command-line client application and a scheduling and policy daemon that wraps Iperf and Thrulay.
> * [Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT)](http://software.internet2.edu/ndt/) NDT is a user-friendly client/server program that provides network configuration and performance testing to a userâ€™s desktop or laptop computer.
> * [One-Way Ping (OWAMP)](http://software.internet2.edu/owamp/) OWAMP is a command-line client application and a policy daemon used to determine one-way latencies between hosts.         
> For additional information regarding the use of these tools, you may contact us using Phone 336-256-8324 and email 6tech@uncg.edu

Can I connect to the gcrNet with an Apple computer?
> Yes. Apple computers can connect to the gcrNet provided they have a Thunderbolt port and an [external network card](https://store.apple.com/us/product/HC294LL/A/atto-thunderlink-nt1102-thunderbolt-to-10-gbits-ethernet-desklink-device)
> Please review the minimum workstation system requirements to determine if a hardware upgrade will be required.

## Security

Can my gcrNet workstation be physically connected to the GCN Enterprise Network simultaneously?

> No. Your gcrNet workstation may only connect to the gcrNet.


Can I access resources on the Science DMZ from outside the network?

> Yes, services within the Science DMZ will be available outside the network.
