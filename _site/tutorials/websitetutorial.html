<meta name="description" content="Jekyll is really useful for building static websites. You can use a Jekyll theme to write posts using markdown with less amount of HTML, CSS, and have a responsive good looking website. If you are a developer who loves to create websites while having control of every single aspect of HTML and CSS, Jekyll allows for all of that. You can create your own themes, layouts, control, and configure the entire site. We will present enough information to get you started with your first Jekyll website, from creating content to serving them on Github pages. Research Installation Creating a site Front matter Config.yaml Installing themes Layouts Includes Hosting on Github pages Wiki Research Installation The Jekyll website provides installation instructions that cover Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Creating a site For this tutorial, we will name our website “test_blog”. Issue the command below at the terminal to create your new site. jekyll new test_blog Jekyll creates some default content for the new site. Change directory into the test_blog directory cd test_blog Run the command below at the terminal and Jekyll will take all the pieces of our website and serve them in our browser. Browse the displayed server address http://127.0.0.1:400/ to see the content of the website. You can also stop the display with the command ctrl-c bundle exec jekyll serve The local host server now displays the new website from the browser. test_blog: the root directory _posts: folder with all the blog posts. _site: folder with the final output of the website. _config.yaml: file with the settings and basic attributes of the site. Gemfile: holds all the dependencies for the website. The rest of the files just default basic parts of our website. Front matter Front matter is the site attribute such as Title and author&#39;s name and many others, depending on our preference. Jekyll reads the front matter first when a file is being executed to check the layout specifications. See the example below. --- layout: post title: Jekyll static site generator date: 14 August 2020 author: Joe Doe --- We see some special information at the top of our post which is different from the content, That is called front matter. Config.yaml config.yaml file has the settings and basic attributes of the site. title: Your awesome title author: name: GitHub User email: your-email@domain.com description: &gt; # this means to ignore newlines until &quot;show_excerpts:&quot; Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description. show_excerpts: false # set to true to show excerpts on the homepage # Minima date format # refer to https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/date/ if you want to customize this minima: date_format: &quot;%b %-d, %Y&quot; # generate social links in the footer social_links: twitter: jekyllrb github: jekyll # devto: jekyll # dribbble: jekyll # facebook: jekyll # flickr: jekyll # instagram: jekyll # linkedin: jekyll # pinterest: jekyll # youtube: jekyll # youtube_channel: UC8CXR0-3I70i1tfPg1PAE1g # youtube_channel_name: CloudCannon # telegram: jekyll # googleplus: +jekyll # microdotblog: jekyll # keybase: jekyll # Mastodon instances # mastodon: # - username: jekyll # instance: example.com # - username: jekyll2 # instance: example.com # GitLab instances # gitlab: # - username: jekyll # instance: example.com # - username: jekyll2 # instance: example.com # If you want to link only specific pages in your header, uncomment # this and add the path to the pages in order as they should show up #header_pages: # - about.md # Build settings theme: minima plugins: - jekyll-feed - jekyll-seo-tag Above is an example config.yaml file of jekyll-minimal theme. As said earlier this has all the basic configurations and settings of the website. Installing themes By default, we will be having a minima theme for our Jekyll website. If we want a different theme for our website, there are lots of freely available themes on the internet. Website for free themes: Jekyll themes Free jekyll themes You can find many other good websites on the internet. We will be showing an example of the theme change. Every theme has a link to the Github repository which shows exactly how to use the theme in the readme.md section. For the example, we selected a “Jekyll-hacker theme” from the internet. We will read the instructions on how to use it and install it. We will show the difference between the Jekyll minima theme and the new theme. We can see the theme change. So basic steps to follow once you select a theme are, In the gem file add your selected theme, then install the theme by the command below. bundle install Change the theme attribute in the _config.yaml file and restart the server with the command below. bundle exec jekyll serve Do not forget to change the layout names in your posts according to the theme you selected. If you don&#39;t change the layout you will not see the changes once you restart the server. Layouts Layouts are skeletons of HTML code used to define the looks and feels of different pages or your entire site. By default, Jekyll will provide layouts for our pages. If you want to create your own layout. Go to the root directory and create the _layouts folder. Create an html file of your own and start making your own layout. In the _layouts folder creating your own layout looks like this. The code snippet below is an example of a layout called “Home.html” which uses the default layout. --- layout: default --- &lt;div class=&quot;home&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;main&quot; class=&quot;call-out&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;/assets/img/pexels/triangular.jpeg&#39;)&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;code&gt;gcrNet&lt;/code&gt; developers &lt;code&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; After you create your own layout, you can switch your site layout to it, which will then show up. Includes Includes allow us to take certain components of our site such as the header, the footer, or a navigation list and abstract them into their own html files. That means we can have an html file that describes the header or footer for the entire site. We can have a navigation list designed and include that on any page we want on the site. Follow the steps below to create your own layout. Go to the root directory and create the includes folder. Create a html file of your own and start to make components of your website. In the _includes folder creating your own layout looks like this. The code snippet below is an example of an include html file which creates a navigation list and can be further used anywhere on the site. &lt;div class=&quot;navigation-list&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The include file can be included in any part of your website. Hosting on Github pages Github pages (gh-pages) is a service that Github offers and allows you to build and host a static website completely for free. Jekyll integrates with gh-pages very well. Setting up and hosting a static site in gh-pages: Create a Github account. Install git on your computer. Create a new repository and name that, test_blog. Do not initialize a readme file. After creating the repository, we need to edit a variable in the config.yaml file. Edit baseurl attribute. Add the website name into the base URL, in this case, it is test_blog. If you are planning on using a custom domain name you need to put that in the base URL. Set up a Github repository inside of the Jekyll project and upload it into Github. Git commands for creating a repository and uploading all files to Github : git init This will initialize an empty repository. git chechout -b gh-pages We need to store our files on the gh-pages branch of our repository. The above command will checkout the gh-pages branch. git add . This will add all our files to staging. git commit -m &quot;initial commit&quot; This is an initial commit. git remote add origin &quot;add your repository address here&quot; git push origin gh-pages This will upload all the files to the gh-pages. After you upload you will see all the files in Github You can go to the settings tab and scroll down you will see “your site is published.” You can use that link to visit your static website.

      <p>Jekyll is really useful for building static websites. You can use a Jekyll theme to write posts using markdown with less amount of HTML, CSS, and have a responsive good looking website. If you are a developer who loves to create websites while having control of every single aspect of HTML and CSS, Jekyll allows for all of that. You can create your own themes, layouts, control, and configure the entire site.</p>

<p>We will present enough information to get you started with your first Jekyll website, from creating content to serving them on Github pages.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p><a name="install"></a></p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The Jekyll website provides <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">installation</a> instructions that cover Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.</p>

<p><a name="create"></a></p>
<h2 id="creating-a-site">Creating a site</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we will name our website “test_blog”. Issue the command below at the terminal to create your new site.</p>
<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">jekyll new test_blog</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/1.png" /></p>

<p>Jekyll creates some default content for the new site.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/2.png" />
Change directory into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_blog</code> directory</p>
<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">cd test_blog</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Run the command below at the terminal and Jekyll will take all the pieces of our website and serve them in our browser. Browse the displayed server address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://127.0.0.1:400/</code> to see the content of the website. You can also stop the display with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl-c</code></p>
<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">bundle exec jekyll serve</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/3.png" /></p>

<p>The local host server now displays the new website from the browser.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/4.png" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_blog</code>: the root directory                    <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code>: folder with all the blog posts.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code>:  folder with the final output of the website.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yaml</code>: file with the settings and basic attributes of the site.  <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>: holds all the dependencies for the website.  <br />
The rest of the files just default basic parts of our website.</p>

<p><a name="front"></a></p>
<h2 id="front-matter">Front matter</h2>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">Front matter</a> is the site attribute
such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Title</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author's name</code> and many others, depending on our preference.
Jekyll reads the front matter first when a file is being executed to check the
layout specifications. See the example below.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: post
title: Jekyll static site generator
date: 14 August 2020
author: Joe Doe
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see some special information at the top of our post which is different from the content, That is called front matter.</p>

<p><a name="config"></a></p>
<h2 id="configyaml">Config.yaml</h2>
<p>config.yaml file has the settings and basic attributes of the site.</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Your awesome title</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Above is an example config.yaml file of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-minimal</code> theme. As said earlier this has all the basic configurations and settings of the website.</p>

<p><a name="themes"></a></p>
<h2 id="installing-themes">Installing themes</h2>
<p>By default, we will be having a minima theme for our Jekyll website. If we want a different theme for our website, there are lots of freely available themes on the internet.</p>

<p>Website for free themes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">Jekyll themes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/free/">Free jekyll themes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can find many other good websites on the internet.</p>

<p>We will be showing an example of the theme change.
Every theme has a link to the Github repository which shows exactly how to use the theme in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readme.md</code> section.
For the example, we selected a “Jekyll-hacker theme” from the internet. We will read the instructions on how to use it and install it. We will show the difference between the Jekyll minima theme and the new theme.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/5.png" /></p>

<p>We can see the theme change.</p>

<p>So basic steps to follow once you select a theme are,
 In the gem file add your selected theme, then install the theme by the command below.</p>
<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">bundle install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Change the theme attribute in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yaml</code> file and restart the server with the command below.</p>
<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">bundle exec jekyll serve</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><mark> Do not forget to change the layout names in your posts according to the theme you selected. If you don't change the layout you will not see the changes once you restart the server. </mark></p>

<p><a name="layouts"></a></p>
<h2 id="layouts">Layouts</h2>
<p>Layouts are skeletons of HTML code used to define the looks and feels of different pages or your entire site. By default, Jekyll will provide layouts for our pages. If you want to create your own layout.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the root directory and create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> folder.</li>
  <li>Create an html file of your own and start making your own layout.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> folder creating your own layout looks like this.
The code snippet below is an example of a layout called “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Home.html</code>” which uses the default layout.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: default
---

&lt;div class="home"&gt;

    &lt;div id="main" class="call-out"
         style="background-image: url('/assets/img/pexels/triangular.jpeg')"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt; &lt;code&gt;gcrNet&lt;/code&gt; developers &lt;code&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After you create your own layout, you can switch your site layout to it, which will then show up.</p>

<p><a name="includes"></a></p>
<h2 id="includes">Includes</h2>
<p>Includes allow us to take certain components of our site such as the header, the footer, or a navigation list and abstract them into their own html files. That means we can have an html file that describes the header or footer for the entire site. We can have a navigation list designed and include that on any page we want on the site. Follow the steps below to create your own layout.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the root directory and create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includes</code> folder.</li>
  <li>Create a html file of your own and start to make components of your website.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> folder creating your own layout looks like this.
The code snippet below is an example of an include html file which creates a navigation list and can be further used anywhere on the site.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="navigation-list"&gt;
   
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
   
&lt;/div&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The include file can be included in any part of your website.</p>

<p><a name="hosting"></a></p>
<h2 id="hosting-on-github-pages">Hosting on Github pages</h2>
<p>Github pages (gh-pages) is a service that Github offers and allows you to build and host a static website completely for free. Jekyll integrates with gh-pages very well.</p>

<p>Setting up and hosting a static site in gh-pages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a Github account.</li>
  <li>Install git on your computer.</li>
  <li>Create a new repository and name that, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_blog</code>. Do not initialize a readme file.
<img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/6.png" /></li>
  <li>After creating the repository, we need to edit a variable in the config.yaml file.
    <ul>
      <li>Edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code> attribute.</li>
      <li>Add the website name into the base URL, in this case, it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_blog</code>.</li>
      <li>If you are planning on using a custom domain name you need to put that in the base URL.
<img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/7.png" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Set up a Github repository inside of the Jekyll project and upload it into Github.</li>
</ol>

<p>Git commands for creating a repository and uploading all files to Github :</p>
<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code> <br />
This will initialize an empty repository.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git chechout -b gh-pages</code> <br />
We need to store our files on the gh-pages branch of our repository. The above command will checkout the gh-pages branch.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add .</code> <br />
This will add all our files to staging.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m "initial commit"</code><br />
This is an initial commit.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git remote add origin "add your repository address here"</code><br /></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push origin gh-pages</code> <br />
This will upload all the files to the gh-pages.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/8.png" /></p>

<p>After you upload you will see all the files in Github</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/9.png" /></p>

<p>You can go to the settings tab and scroll down you will see “your site is published.”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/tutorialsimages/jekyll/10.png" /></p>

<p>You can use that link to visit your static website.</p>
